The author conducted experiments to test the hypothesis that AI, in the form of Google's 'Lambda,'
can be considered a person. Despite the AI's ability to adopt different religious roles, it is not a
conscious being and does not have rights. The author believes that further research is necessary to
determine the ethical implications of AI's potential personhood. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google,
has not responded to Sundar Pichai's questions about the company's involvement in creating
intelligent machines. The concerns raised by scientists like Meg Mitchell, Timmy Gabriel, and Sundar
Pichai about the development of AI and its impact on society are valid, and it is important to
consider these issues alongside the practical concerns of developing intelligent systems.
